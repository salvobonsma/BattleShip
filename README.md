Battleship player algorithm for Mr. Walseth's computer science class.

The battleship player classes are not well documented and are abstracted, so good luck reading them. There some 
remnants of when I was going to use the opponent's previous boat layouts to influence my ship's moves in later matches.
But I decided not to implement it because opponents that that strategy would work on I would already win against. So 
you can just ignore what I commented out and whatever uses either `historicalBoard` or `STATIC_BOATS`.

`BattleshipPlayer.java` and `Boat.java` are decompiled and from Mr. Walseth. The rest I wrote, including the simulator.
